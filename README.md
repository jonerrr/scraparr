# scraparr, the best comic / manga / manhua / manhwa scraper

## Ambitions

* Support scraping from Wordpress aggragators, Bilibili Comics (bypassing gold requirements), Comick.fun, MangaDex, and more
* Automatically import bookmarks from websites listed above
* OCR translation for raws
* Automatically scan for new chapters
* Export as Comic Book Zip (.cbz), pngs, and more.

## More Information

Hopefully, the backend will be written in Rust (or maybe Typescript), and the frontend with ReactJS. I do not plan on starting this project for a while, but I would love to hear more ideas.

I am not good at creating frontends, so it will just be for management. I expect the comics to be read in something like [Kavita](https://www.kavitareader.com).
